title = "About me"
+++

My name is Helen and I am an aspiring data scientist.

![This is me][1]

My background is in social science. My undergraduate degree was in economics and politics, and I have a PhD in social policy from the University of Edinburgh. My doctoral research looked at employment attachment among mothers in the [British birth cohort studies](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-centres/centres/centre-for-longitudinal-studies/layout-components/accordion/birth-cohort-studies), and I went on to work with most of the major UK and European social surveys in my post-PhD life as a Research Fellow at Edinburgh Napier University, researching labour market and equalities issues.

## So why data science?

It's all the things I have enjoyed about my career to date - finding, manipulating, analysing and presenting data. 

I am currently at the dissertation stage of an [MSc in Big Data](https://www.stir.ac.uk/courses/pg-taught/computing-and-data-science/big-data/) at the University of Stirling. My dissertation will use text mining and sentiment analysis to look at how hostility manifests itself online.

And then...employment! Someone hire me? 

## What do you do when you're not analysing data?

I play the violin in the [New Edinburgh Orchestra](http://www.newedinburghorchestra.org.uk/), and I also enjoy hiking, cooking and homebrewing.
