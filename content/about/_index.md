My name is Helen and I am a data scientist. I wrangle data for the [Food Standards Agency](http://www.food.gov.uk).

![This is me][1]

## The back story

My background is in social science. My undergraduate degree was in economics and politics, and I have a PhD in social policy from the University of Edinburgh. My doctoral research looked at employment attachment among mothers in the [British birth cohort studies](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-centres/centres/centre-for-longitudinal-studies/layout-components/accordion/birth-cohort-studies), and I went on to work with most of the major UK and European social surveys in my post-PhD life as a Research Fellow at Edinburgh Napier University, researching labour market and equalities issues.

## So why data science?

I wanted an escape from academia, and data science was becoming a Big Thing (if only it had been when I was a PhD student, or better yet an undergrad). It seemed to be all the things I had enjoyed about my career to date - finding, manipulating, analysing and presenting data. I had the generic skills but lacked some specific ones.

So I took it upon myself to do an [MSc in Big Data](https://www.stir.ac.uk/courses/pg-taught/computing-and-data-science/big-data/) at the University of Stirling. I learned a load of stuff about databases and machine learning, and my dissertation used text mining and sentiment analysis to look at how hostility manifests itself online.

And then... I got a job! Someone hired me to be an actual real life data scientist. 

## What do you do when you're not analysing data?

Singing, playing the violin, hiking, cooking and homebrewing.
