I made a personal website/blog, and so can you!

Well, I feel I am exaggerating somewhat when I claim I made a website. I downloaded the R `blogdown` package, which created a site using a ready made Hugo theme [(Creative Portfolio)](https://github.com/kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme), so I can't really take credit for *making* the site. But I did have to figure out from a standing start how to do those things.

There are loads of tutorials online so I'm not going to reinvent the wheel, just point towards the things I found useful.

I initially created a simple, two-page about me + contact details website using `rmarkdown` and publishing it on GitHub Pages. This was fairly straightforward thanks to [Emily Zabor's helpful tutorial](http://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html), with a bit of help on the GitHub side from [Jenny Bryan's *Happy Git* book](http://happygitwithr.com/). You make the Rmarkdown files, R knits you a website, you push the files to the GitHub repo and publish them using GitHub Pages. If you're not a complete Git n00b like me you could probably have this up and running in no time at all.

However, doing it that way didn't really leave me with much scope to create a blog, which is the other reason I wanted an online presence. I do lots of bits and pieces of data analysis, whenever I learn something new or an idea strikes me, and I want an outlet for it. Maybe someone will find it useful, maybe someone much more experienced than me will absolutely slate it, both of those things are fine.

So I went with the `blogdown` package. [This tutorial](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) by Alison Presmanes Hill is a good step by step guide, in conjunction with this [book about blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie (who wrote the package) for some more background and technical information about the process. This approach uses Netlify to deploy the site rather than GitHub pages. It's all gone pretty smoothly so far, apart from when I tried to tinker with the theme and got an error - I googled, but I don't know enough about Hugo to even understand the answers! RStudio has some really useful add-in buttons (serve site, new post, add image) that make it easier to add content.

Ah yes, content. That's the next thing I need...
