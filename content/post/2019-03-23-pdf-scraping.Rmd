I've had the unfortunate task recently of having to liberate some 
data from pdfs; all part of the 'Sexiest Job In The World'(TM). 
Fortunately after some blundering about 
I've managed to get a decent result, and I thought I'd write up the process because it's no 
doubt something I'm going to have to do again, and in case anyone else finds it useful.

The `pdftools` package has been around for a while, allowing you to extract data line by 
line from a pdf. However, a relatively new feature (launched late last year) is the 
`pdf_data()` function, which 
tells you the position on the page of every word you extract. This is particularly useful if 
you are trying to extract a table and can't rely on inferring delimiters from whitespace.

The example I'm using here is not the pdf I was scraping for work, because that one is 
extremely long and boring (unless you are *fascinated* by which types of colouring you 
are allowed to feed to ornamental fish, or which gut flora stabilisers are permitted for 
weaned piglets). Instead, I've picked a simpler table as an
illustrative example, from the very interesting world of the 
['Minimum Income Standard'](https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/minimum-income-standard-britain-what-people-think).
This is a consensus based measure of how much money is required to live to an acceptable 
minimum standard in the UK today. Some of the headline tables are in a more easily 
scrapable html page, but the detail is buried in a pdf. And maybe you want that for some 
reason? For example, Table 3 in the report gives the amounts that different family types 
are judged to need for spending on different things.

<br>
This table is on page 33 of the pdf, so I start by grabbing everything on that page. The 
`pdf_data()` function produces a list with one item per page, so I select the 33rd.

```{r warning = FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(pdftools)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

pdfdata <- pdf_data("https://www.jrf.org.uk/file/37389/download?token=XeWAW_2J&filetype=full-report") %>% 
  .[[33]]
head(pdfdata)
```

It grabs every word, one per line of the table, along with its width, height and position 
on the page. But how do you make sense of that?? How do you turn this into a table?
The [blog post](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2018/12/14/pdftools-20/) 
that launched the new feature helpfully says:
"Converting this pdf data into the original data frame is left as an exercise for the 
reader :)" with the smiley face and everything, trololol. 
So I had to work out a way, which I did, and as ever I'm not convinced it's the cleverest,
easiest or quickest way...but it's a way!

To illustrate what the numbers mean in practice, here is how the title of the 
table is represented:

```{r }
pdfdata[106:115,]
```

All the words have a y co-ordinate of 226, and you can also see how these words 
are spread along the x axis from 72 to 340. 

I'm not really interested in the title, the first thing I want is the header, which is
on two rows, and I can find out which by searching for the relevant text:

```{r }
pdfdata %>% 
  filter(grepl("Single|Pensioner|Couple|Lone",text))

pdfdata %>% 
  filter(grepl("Commodity|working|couple|children",text))
```

The header is on rows 244 and 256. Where is the bottom of the table?
I don't want the totals rows, so I only want to go as far as the row with "Rent".

```{r }
pdfdata %>% 
  filter(text == "Rent")
```

This is y = 531. Where are the rows between this?

```{r }
pdfdata %>% 
  filter(y > 256 & y < 531) %>% 
  select(y) %>% 
  unique()
```

17 rows - yup you can see from the table that's right. 
So we know where the rows start and end. What about the columns?
Look for the leftmost word in each:

```{r }
pdfdata %>% 
  filter(grepl("Commodity|working|Pensioner|\\+|Lone", text)) %>% 
  arrange(x)
```

Now we have the numbers the table can be visualised thus (dodgy paint drawings are 
not an essential part of this process):

From here it's a relatively straightforward merging exercise. I 
start by restricting the data I'm working with to within the dimensions of interest, from 
the header to the rent expenditure row.

```{r }
tabledata <- pdfdata %>% 
  filter(x >= 72) %>% 
  filter(y >= 244 & y <= 531) %>% 
  arrange(x,y)
```

Mercifully, all the text in each row is on the same y dimension (different sized fonts in different 
columns meant that this was not the case in the data I was
dealing with at work!). So each row is represented by a single y value.
But I will need to cut the x values into columns, using the values identified above as
cut points (minus 1 to catch everything). Then it's just a case of collapsing together 
the data within each cell - i.e. each row/column combination - and then a `spread()`.
Finally the top two rows need to be collapsed together into a single row.

```{r }
mistable <- tabledata %>% 
  mutate(col = cut(x, breaks = c(71, 230, 310, 382, 456, Inf), 
                   labels = as.character(c(1:5)))) %>% 
  arrange(col, y) %>% 
  group_by(col, y) %>% 
  mutate(text = paste(text, collapse = " ")) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  select(y, text, col) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  spread(col, text) %>% 
  mutate(row = c(1,1:19)) %>% 
  replace(., is.na(.), "") %>% 
  group_by(row) %>% 
  summarise_all(paste, collapse = " ") %>%
  mutate_all(., trimws) %>% 
  select(-row, -y)
```

Nearly there! now just need to make the top row the column names, and
get rid of the penultimate row.

```{r }
colnames(mistable) <- mistable[1,]

mistable <- mistable %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  slice(-(nrow(.)-1))

kable(mistable, align = "lcccc",
      caption = "Components of the Minimum Income Standard for four family types") %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
  footnote(general = "Source: https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/minimum-income-standard-britain-what-people-think")
```

That's the table! You can admire it, or use the data to make a picture 
(after coercing it into a tidy format first). 

```{r finalpic}
mistable %>% 
  filter(Commodity != "Tobacco" & Commodity != "Motoring") %>% 
  gather(famtype, amount, -Commodity) %>% 
  mutate(amount = as.numeric(amount)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(famtype, amount, fill = Commodity)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack", colour = "black", size = 0.5) +
  coord_flip() +
  ylab("Family type")
```

You can see the relative size of the total budget and its components for the different family 
types (sort of, yeah yeah it's not the best viz in the world, I've run out of steam after 
all that pdf wrangling.) Look at the size of the childcare component (shown here in orange)!
